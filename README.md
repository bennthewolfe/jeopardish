# Jeopardish
## Summary
This is a jeopardy clone powered by jquery for me to play with my family.

Repo : https://github.com/bennthewolfe/jeopardish

## One-time Set-up
1. Install Node JS
2. Run ```npm install```

## Instructions
1. Run ```node --watch server.js``` or ```npm start``` to start the Express API
2. Luanch in a browser (currently requires internet connection)

## Ideas
- [ ] Attach to a Jeopardy API?
- [ ] Download dependencies for offline play
- [x] Use the JQuery data to store all this data on the cells instead of text in divs (done 2/27/25)
- [ ] Use the search bar in nav to create a json game file on the fly (with chat gpt API)
